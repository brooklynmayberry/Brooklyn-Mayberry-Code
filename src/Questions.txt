1.) What happens if you provide a negative value for the port in TestClackClient?

A: Currently, there is no error with a negative port value (the way that our code is structured),
however a negative port value might cause connection issues in later implementations of the
project. In order to protect against this, we could check to see if the port is negative at creation
and spit out an error if the port is negative. We could also decide to take the absolute value of
the port number, however, this approach could cause objects that need to connect to different ports
to connect to the same port.

2.) What if you provide a null value for the username?

A: The program will throw a NullPointerException whenever it needs to call one of its methods.
In order to fix this, you could put in a test to make sure that the object is not null, and
send an error message if it is null. Alternatively, you might be able to instantiate it using
the default constructor, as long as that wouldn't cause another error.

I'm unsure of the correctness of these answers
